# About this Repo

This is the repo that I started with when I began working on this Tetris app. But sometimer after I finished the app, I combined all of the files to another repo for my github-hosted domain name joooons.github.io.

So, if you want to try the Tetris app, go [HERE](https://joooons.github.io/tetris).

If you want to examine the repo, you can take look around here. As of 8/28/2020, the script for Tetris is identical in both repos.
